# Using pyota on an IoT device

<b>Use what you learned in this Python IOTA Workshop, along with this step-by-step guide, to build an Autonomous Gardener</b>

An Autonomous Gardener is a device that uses iota tokens to buy water based on a pre-negotiated contract.  This tutorial introduces the process of machine-2-machine payments using text-based json contracts and the Tangle.

The use-case for an autonomous gardener comes from the coffee bean supply chain.  Rather than farmers hiring accountants to pay the monthly water bill, the autonomous gardener can buy water when plants are thirsty.  Each time, water is purchased, there is an immutable record stored on the Tangle.  Farmers can prove that plants were watered on-time from a specific source of water.
